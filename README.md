An app geared towards organizing school lost and founds. School staff can take pictures of left-behind-items and upload them to the app with a description. Students and parents can view these lost items and claim them through the app.
I created the UI and functionality for the app. I learned how to work with CloudKit, SwiftUI, dynamic views, etc.

This app was a learning experience for me and helped me learn Swift, SwiftUI, and XCode. The app uses JSON files to store data and utilizes dynamic views.
