Lost & Found app:
https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/Minnesota-School-Lost-Found

An app geared towards organizing school lost and founds. School staff can take pictures of left-behind-items and upload them to the app with a description. Students and parents can view these lost items and claim them through the app.
I have worked on coding the all views and the current functionality. Right now I am working on adding CloudKit capabilities for easy sharing between staff and students.
