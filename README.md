# [Missing Stuff](https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/Minnesota-School-Lost-Found)
* The lost and found at my high school is filled to the brim with items; students can spend hours looking through piles of coats and still come out with nothing. The purpose of the Missing Stuff App app is to create a place where staff members can take pictures of items in the lost and found and students can then easily see what is in the lost and found without digging through piles of items. 
* This was the main project that I worked on in iOS App Development. I mainly worked on the backend of the app, creating the complete functionality. I also added UI features and designs to make the app look good.

# [Post It App](https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/Spring2022GroupProject) 
* Each year, students in AP CSP create Post-It note instalations around EPHS. In iOS App Development, we created a game that encourages students to look for the art around the school and take pictures of it in order to earn points. I was the project manager for this project, meaning I assigned tasks and ensured they got done within a reasonable time. I also helped with the UI designs.

# [Crypto Market Game](https://github.com/maxj723/CryptoMarket)
* This app was a learning experience for me and helped me learn Swift, SwiftUI, and XCode. The app uses JSON files to store data and utilizes dynamic views. It is unfinished, though it was very helpful in practicing Swift.
