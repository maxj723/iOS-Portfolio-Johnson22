This app was a learning experience for me and helped me learn Swift, SwiftUI, and XCode. The app uses JSON files to store data and utilizes dynamic views.

An app geared towards organizing school lost and founds. School staff can take pictures of left-behind-items and upload them to the app with a description. Students and parents can view these lost items and claim them through the app.
I have worked on coding the all views and the current functionality. Right now I am working on adding CloudKit capabilities for easy sharing between staff and students.
